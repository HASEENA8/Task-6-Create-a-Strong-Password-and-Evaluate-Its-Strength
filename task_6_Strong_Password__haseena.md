Task 6: Password Strength Testing

Objective:
To evaluate password strength using the tool howsecureismypassword.net and understand how different combinations affect the time it would take to crack a password.

Passwords Tested:

**Password 1:** [Not displayed for safety]  
**Tool Used:** howsecureismypassword.net  
**Estimated Crack Time:** Trillions of years  
**Feedback:** Extremely strong password. Includes symbols, numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and good length.  

**Password 2:** [Not displayed for safety]  
**Tool Used:** howsecureismypassword.net  
**Estimated Crack Time:** Hundreds of billions of years  
**Feedback:** Very strong password with complex structure and long length.

**Password 3:** [Not displayed for safety]  
**Tool Used:** howsecureismypassword.net  
**Estimated Crack Time:** Millions of years  
**Feedback:** Strong password but could be improved with more characters or varied symbols.

**Password 4:** [Not displayed for safety]  
**Tool Used:** howsecureismypassword.net  
**Estimated Crack Time:** Billions of years  
**Feedback:** Robust password using a mix of characters and good length.

**Weak Password:** [e.g., "12345678"]  
**Tool Used:** howsecureismypassword.net  
**Estimated Crack Time:** Instantly  
**Feedback:** Very weak password. Common and easily guessed. Avoid using such passwords.

Conclusion:
Strong passwords greatly enhance account security. This task has emphasized the importance of using complex, unique, and lengthy passwords. I will adopt better password practices going forward, including using a password manager.
